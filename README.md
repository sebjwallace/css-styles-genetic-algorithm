# css-styles-genetic-algorithm
supervised genetic algorithm for css styles

A simple script and UI for evolving CSS styles on a sample DOM element (a button). The initial population has random styles assigned to the button. Upon selecting five buttons that visually appeal most to the user, the population will be regenerated as children by using crossover and mutation. After a number of iterations the styles of the buttons will become more specific around the particular style the user has evolved.
